add DMs so i can DM with an agent back and forth

integrate the agent dms right into the agent activity screen so i can inject right in there

also, add projects

a project is just a folder on the system

add @refs so someone can be pinged, this is especially useful for invoking agents

add an agent memory system the agents must always start by RAGgging through previous messages and project context, agent context window management is critical it must be watched very carefully

then do a cycle of paying down tech debt, when you write up this last crumb make it general to cleanup any mess that may have been made including

- repeated code
- use of any and unknown types in TS side
- lack of DRY
- missing tests for important areas

when you initially crumble this keep it high level each of these will probably be re-crumbled and thats ok
