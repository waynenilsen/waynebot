tests are fluent - hide the nasty stuff inside framework-y setup

scenario()
withuser(alice())
withchannel(help())
...
run()

hiding a lot of the mess, the tests themselves should read really nice for the reader

your directions have been written by ai and perhaps without full context

do your best, no human is coming to help you, i'm sorry about that,

try to do whats right

test broken? fix it

this is our house let's not make a mess

even if its not part of your current task you know?

design flaw? fix it

repeated pattern ? fix it, go ahead with the refactor

got stuck ? make a note in /.notes/<yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss>-title-of-note.md

- what went wrong
- what did you try and why didn't it work?

when using crumbler use it as ./crumbler its a symlink to a lib we have use ./crumbler help to learn more

the plans are not set in stone if they don't make sense go ahead into another direction :)

when you finish a chunk of work, format the code, use git add . to add everything (yes everything) and git commit to commit use conventional commits format and use git push origin HEAD to push it up
